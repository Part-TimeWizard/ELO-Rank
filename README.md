# ELO Rank ReadMe
Everyone thinks they’re the best at a certain game. Whether it’s ping-pong, Mario Kart, Joust,
or even pickup basketball, everyone has their favorite casual game where they think they can
beat all their friends. We set out to find a way to prove, with mathematical evidence, that we
were better than them at certain games (and then cue the trash talk).
