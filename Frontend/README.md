# Frontend ReadMe

This is the Frontend for RustRank, which is coded in React.js.

## How to Run
1. Launch Docker
2. Navigate to `Frontend` folder
3. Run the following: `docker-compose up --build`
5. When done, `CTRL + C` to shut down image then run `docker-compose down --volumes`

Note: This is really slow, if all of your installs are up to date, you can do npm run start
